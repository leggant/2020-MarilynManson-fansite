<!--                         Marilyn Manson History                          -->
<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Marilyn Manson is an American rock band formed by namesake lead singer Marilyn Manson and guitarist Daisy Berkowitz 
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1989. Originally named Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids, they gained a local cult following 
in South Florida in the early 1990s with their theatrical live performances. In 1993, they were the first act signed to Trent Reznor's 
Nothing Records label. Until 1996, the name of each member was created by combining the first name of a female sex symbol and the 
last name of a serial killer, for example Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson. Their lineup has changed between many of 
their album releases; the eponymous lead singer is the only remaining original member.

In the past, band members dressed in outlandish makeup and costumes, 
and engaged in intentionally shocking behavior both onstage and off. Their lyrics 
often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs, while their 
live performances were frequently called offensive and obscene. On several occasions, protests and petitions led to the group being 
blocked from performing, with at least three US states passing legislation banning the group from performing at state-owned venues. 
They released a number of platinum-selling albums, including Antichrist Superstar (1996) and Mechanical Animals (1998). 
These albums, along with their highly stylized music videos and worldwide touring, brought public recognition to Marilyn Manson. 
In 1999, news media, infamously, falsely blamed the band for influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre.

As this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band's mainstream popularity. Despite this, Jon Wiederhorn of MTV, 
in June 2003, referred to Marilyn Manson as "the only true artist today".[1] Marilyn Manson is widely regarded as being one of the 
most iconic and controversial figures in rock music, with the band and its lead singer influencing numerous other groups and musicians,
 both in metal-associated acts and also in wider popular culture. VH1 ranked Marilyn Manson as the seventy-eighth best rock band on 
 their 100 Great Artists of Hard Rock. They were inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame in 2000, and have been nominated for 
 four Grammy Awards. In the U.S., the band has seen eight of its releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. 
 Marilyn Manson have sold in excess of 50 million records worldwide.
